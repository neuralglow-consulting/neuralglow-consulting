## ✨ About NeuralGlow

**NeuralGlow** is a free, stubborn project stitched from  
10+ years of silent patience, active observation, and graceful rebellion against the predictable.

We believe calm thinking outshines chaotic noise.  
We embrace the beauty of adapting, observing, and occasionally laughing when reality throws confetti at breakfast, meetings, and midnight dreams.

## 🌱 Philosophy

> "Stay calm, grow wiser, plant curiosity like seeds."

NeuralGlow isn't fueled by trends or noise.  
It’s built by quiet patience, stubborn clarity, and the refusal to let absurdity win.

- ❌ No grants.  
- ❌ No conflicts.  
- ❌ No noise.

Just pure neural gardening — day and night, absurd sleep included.
